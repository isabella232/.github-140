### Why are there so many forks?

I fork projects here as a Away to mirror them easily. Cloning is not the best practice, and forking them puts them up in their latest state. I still need a way to automate fork updates.

Some projects are forked here because they are related to the subject. For example in language organizations, any project of mine that contains Python source code will be forked to the Python language collection, [@seanpm2001-python](https://github.com/seanpm2001-Python/)

### Why do you have so many organizations?

I manage over a thousand projects, and I feel that organizations are a good way to display their content, and to give them a home. I have organizations for every language I use, every project I have, and also most sub-projects.
